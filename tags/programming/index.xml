      <title>Tailscale for Single User Single Host</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often see articles discussing Tailscale in multi-device setups, but I wanted to share my experience of using Tailscale primarily with a single machine. To clarify, it&amp;rsquo;s not technically a single device, but a combination of my work computer, phone, and a 10-inch Android tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem-inefficient-remote-access&#34;&gt;The Problem: Inefficient Remote Access&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I work from home, and my computer serves as both my personal and work machine. There have been many times when Iâ€™ve needed to assist colleagues or push changes while away from my desk. In emergencies, I used to rely on AnyDesk to remote into my computer via my phone or tablet. While AnyDesk and similar tools like TeamViewer provide visual control over the desktop, they often suffer from lag, disconnections, and poor responsiveness on weaker connections, making simple tasks like opening a terminal or editing a file feel like a chore. The lag becomes especially pronounced when navigating large projects or deploying code, turning a few-minute task into a frustrating, time-consuming ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESP 32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on chip micro controllers with integrated Wi-FI and Bluetooth. SoC or system on chip is an integrated circuit that integrates all or most of the component of a computer. Example the CPU, RAM, IO interface, GPU, etc. This form is becoming more and more popular thanks to growing smartphone and computing industry. Apple M1 chip is a good example on the direction in which SoC&amp;rsquo;s are going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ESP 32 is really low cost it cost like 350 in India, and less than 10$ in the US. Now when you buy this you don&amp;rsquo;t buy the chip alone, but a chip on a development board. There are several articles (&lt;a href=&#34;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&#34;&gt;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&lt;/a&gt;) on that. The board that I bought from amazon was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;, i also bought one with OLED display as well &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about how to get started. We will basically will be setting up Aurdino IDE in linux, followed by flashing few sample programs like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Convert Short Urls to Long Urls</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/convert-short-urls-to-long-urls/</link>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/convert-short-urls-to-long-urls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to get a long/actual url from a short url?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we try to fetch short urls, using curl, we get a blank page as reply or a 301 ERROR. The reason being that there is no html file stored at that location,only a header with details ,on where the person who has opened the url would be redirected to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So to get the actual url or long url from the short url, we just have to read the location stored in the html header.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Many a times I wanted to create my own customized ubuntu, why???&#xA;Well 3 reasons&#xA;I hate having to download the same set of softwares over and over gain, while I reinstall OS. Lot of my friends want the same set of softwares that I use, so making an ISO will help those out without a stable and unlimited net connection. I think its cool. So I have decided to make my own customized ubuntu with lot of programming tools, documentations and compilers added on to it by default.</description>
