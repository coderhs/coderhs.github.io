      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a developer who moved from Windows, to Linux, to macOS, to Linux. A typical developers joruney ðŸ˜†. So moving from
windows to Linux was over 13-14 years ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t much from the windows world other tham games and single executable
files. But moving from macOS to Linux, has been a bit tough. KDE has been able to provide me with everything I want and
more. The one thing that I missed the most was the emoji keyboard, with easy to launch shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usage of emoj was at its peak during macOS days, I used emoji for my communciations, commits, function name and
even terminal aliases. ðŸ˜ˆ Not everyone was fan of my emoji usages, but i loved it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
