      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who has been working with servers for over a decade and a half, I feel embarrassed to admit that I only
recently stumbled upon this setting. Throughout my years of connecting to remote servers over the internet, I&amp;rsquo;ve
encountered instances where connections freeze or break after a period of inactivity. Sometimes it happens more
frequently, while other times it never occurs at all. When I was in the US connecting to Amazon servers, there were
occasions when the connection remained stable for days on end. This led me to believe that the issue might be related
to the internet or the complexity of the network routing required to reach the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
