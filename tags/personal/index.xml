      <description>I am currently a senior Ruby on Rails programmer. This article is my tribute to PHP the language that introduced me to the real world.&#xA;I have been programming or aspiring to program (former/recovering imposter syndrome addict) since I was a child.

During upper primary and high school I spend my time learning Java, C and C++.</description>
