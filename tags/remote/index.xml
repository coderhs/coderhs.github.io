      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who has been working with servers for over a decade and a half, I feel embarrassed to admit that I only&#xA;recently stumbled upon this setting. Throughout my years of connecting to remote servers over the internet, I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;encountered instances where connections freeze or break after a period of inactivity. Sometimes it happens more&#xA;frequently, while other times it never occurs at all. When I was in the US connecting to Amazon servers, there were&#xA;occasions when the connection remained stable for days on end. This led me to believe that the issue might be related&#xA;to the internet or the complexity of the network routing required to reach the server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
