      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time you download a RPM package for installation / updation via yum in Centos / Redhat system it gets deleted automatically after the procedure. Its a rather handy process by which your systems does not waste space storing the installation files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to keep those packages in your system, and maybe create a local repository?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there are several ways. Simplest of them would be to edit the yum configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Many a times I wanted to create my own customized ubuntu, why???
Well 3 reasons
 I hate having to download the same set of softwares over and over gain, while I reinstall OS. Lot of my friends want the same set of softwares that I use, so making an ISO will help those out without a stable and unlimited net connection. I think its cool. So I have decided to make my own customized ubuntu with lot of programming tools, documentations and compilers added on to it by default.</description>
