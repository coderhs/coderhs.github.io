      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESP 32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on chip micro controllers with integrated Wi-FI and Bluetooth. SoC or system on chip is an integrated circuit that integrates all or most of the component of a computer. Example the CPU, RAM, IO interface, GPU, etc. This form is becoming more and more popular thanks to growing smartphone and computing industry. Apple M1 chip is a good example on the direction in which SoC&amp;rsquo;s are going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The ESP 32 is really low cost it cost like 350 in India, and less than 10$ in the US. Now when you buy this you don&amp;rsquo;t buy the chip alone, but a chip on a development board. There are several articles (&lt;a href=&#34;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&#34;&gt;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&lt;/a&gt;) on that. The board that I bought from amazon was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;, i also bought one with OLED display as well &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about how to get started. We will basically will be setting up Aurdino IDE in linux, followed by flashing few sample programs like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
