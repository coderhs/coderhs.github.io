      <description>&lt;p&gt;I live in India, and getting a static IP at home isn’t straightforward. You usually have to go through customer care, sometimes upgrade to a more expensive plan, and even then it’s not always guaranteed. I wanted a simple setup to make one of my apps publicly accessible without paying a lot or dealing with all that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So here’s what I did. I used &lt;strong&gt;Tailscale&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AWS Lightsail&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Nginx Proxy Manager&lt;/strong&gt; to expose my laptop to the internet, safely and securely. And right now, I&amp;rsquo;m running &lt;a href=&#34;https://easyclientlog.com&#34;&gt;https://easyclientlog.com&lt;/a&gt; - next.js application and &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.easyclientlog.com&#34;&gt;https://api.easyclientlog.com&lt;/a&gt; - ruby on rails application, using this exact setup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-a-static-ip&#34;&gt;Getting a Static IP&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I signed up on AWS and went to Lightsail. Picked Mumbai as the region and selected the cheapest Ubuntu server. AWS gives you a static IP for free (in lightsail) as long as it’s attached to a running instance, and the server itself is free for the first three months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This server acts like a relay. It’s the public-facing machine. I don’t run the actual app on it, it just receives the request and forwards it to my laptop at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup NFS Server on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NFS - Network File System is a distributed file system protocol developed by Sun Systems. It facilitates a client computer to have access to file/folder over network like a local folder. This is a easy/simple way to provide persistant storage for your docker-swarm or kubernetes cluster. In both these cases, the container (or pod) run on one of the available nodes (servers), and when we have replicas it will be running on more than one node. So local storage on the server is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With NFS we can directly mount the folder in the container. We can control everything from the configuration file. And thanks to the NFS storage we can increase and reduce node without worries as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wildcard Domain in Pi Hole</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;PiHole is a DNS server that will block ads and website on a DNS level. This is an integral part of my homelab as it blocks a lot of ads on my phones and system, and also easily allows us to manage domains for local application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For homelab I have a docker-swarm which is managed using portainer. I have a nginx proxy manager to map the ports to a proper domain, even provide https using lets encrypt.But PiHole doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a wildcard domain setting, hence after i set or before i set a domain my nginx proxy I need to add it to PiHole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
