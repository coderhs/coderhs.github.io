      <title>Setup NFS Server on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;NFS - Network File System is a distributed file system protocol developed by Sun Systems. It facilitates a client computer to have access to file/folder over network like a local folder. This is a easy/simple way to provide persistant storage for your docker-swarm or kubernetes cluster. In both these cases, the container (or pod) run on one of the available nodes (servers), and when we have replicas it will be running on more than one node. So local storage on the server is out of the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With NFS we can directly mount the folder in the container. We can control everything from the configuration file. And thanks to the NFS storage we can increase and reduce node without worries as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wildcard Domain in Pi Hole</title>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/wildcard-domain-in-pi-hole/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PiHole is a DNS server that will block ads and website on a DNS level. This is an integral part of my homelab as it blocks a lot of ads on my phones and system, and also easily allows us to manage domains for local application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For homelab I have a docker-swarm which is managed using portainer. I have a nginx proxy manager to map the ports to a proper domain, even provide https using lets encrypt.But PiHole doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a wildcard domain setting, hence after i set or before i set a domain my nginx proxy I need to add it to PiHole.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Validating YAML Files in Ruby</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/validating-yaml-files-in-ruby/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 21:27:34 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/validating-yaml-files-in-ruby/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;YAML stands for &amp;ldquo;YAML Ain&amp;rsquo;t Markup Language&amp;rdquo;. YAML is a data serialization language that is often used for writing configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms YAML is like XML or JSON, but for human beings rather than computers. I feel this is getting overlooked a lot, programmers need to understand that. Another human like configuration language I like is TOML (Tom&amp;rsquo;s Obvious Minimal Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a static language (like crystal) you need to define the structure of a YAML or JSON file. Defining the structure also act as validation of its schema. Validating the schema is a good idea because it ensure&amp;rsquo;s that all the required data is present. Its better to know data is missing when your program starts rather than while it is running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For dynamic language like ruby you can load a yaml file, and ruby will dynamically initialize it. It does make your life easier as a programmer. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to define the schema, and remember to update the schema when you add a new variable to your file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But defining the schema has its benefits -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the User: It reminds then to have the configuration filled before running their program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the Developer: It helps us to eliminate the configuration file as a possible reason for the program not running.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which Language Should I Build This Software In?&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Which language should I have this software developed In?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question that software devs gets asked a lot. By there friends/colleague , usually by who are not part of the software industry. This is my answer to them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you had an idea for a novel? or a poem? which language will you write it in. Italian, Tamil, Bengali? Would you try to learn a new language because there are a lot of similar novels (anime) in Chinese or Japanese.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best language to write your novel is the language you know the most.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Getting Started With ESP 32 Development</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/getting-started-with-esp-32-linux/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:42:04 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/getting-started-with-esp-32-linux/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ESP 32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on chip micro controllers with integrated Wi-FI and Bluetooth. SoC or system on chip is an integrated circuit that integrates all or most of the component of a computer. Example the CPU, RAM, IO interface, GPU, etc. This form is becoming more and more popular thanks to growing smartphone and computing industry. Apple M1 chip is a good example on the direction in which SoC&amp;rsquo;s are going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ESP 32 is really low cost it cost like 350 in India, and less than 10$ in the US. Now when you buy this you don&amp;rsquo;t buy the chip alone, but a chip on a development board. There are several articles (&lt;a href=&#34;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&#34;&gt;https://makeradvisor.com/esp32-development-boards-review-comparison/&lt;/a&gt;) on that. The board that I bought from amazon was this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0718T232Z?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;, i also bought one with OLED display as well &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&#34;&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DKD79Y9?psc=1&amp;amp;ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I will be talking about how to get started. We will basically will be setting up Aurdino IDE in linux, followed by flashing few sample programs like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Amazing Emoji Keyboard in Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a developer who moved from Windows, to Linux, to macOS, to Linux. A typical developer&amp;rsquo;s journey 😆. So moving from
windows to Linux was over 13-14 years ago. I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much from the windows world other than games and single executable
files. But moving from macOS to Linux, has been a bit tough. KDE has been able to provide me with everything I want and
more. The one thing that I missed the most was the emoji keyboard, with easy to launch shortcut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My usage of emoji was at its peak during macOS days, I used emoji for my communications, commits, function name and
even terminal aliases. 😈 Not everyone was a fan of my emoji usages, but I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Running Migrations From Console</title>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/running-migrations-from-console/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I am using Apartment gem to manage my multi schema database, and this article is written with expectation you know and use that gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple schema in your rails application, it is important for them to remain consistent. Rails migration is run by keeping track of the timestamp prefixed in front of its file name. It stores the database. So when you restore a schema that hasn&amp;rsquo;t ran the migration, but rest of the schemas has it, rails thinks it has already ran the migration. Rails look at the main / default schema to know if it has ran the migrations  and then follow up on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This tutorial or concept uses two softwares to make remote coding on your home machine possible.
 Tailscale code-server  Tailscale is basically a VPN using open source wireguard protocol. It creates an encrypted point to point connection so that only your devices can talk to each other.
So you can build a secure connection between your two computers over the internet. These two computers can be across the world, and they will be as if they are on a same network.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we create a new server in aws, it allows us to generate a key pair and attach it to the server. Now imagine you want to share access to this multiple people in your team, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to share your private key. This is what you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generate new key for each member of your team or ask each member for there public keys&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add it to the authorized_keys list in your servers &lt;code&gt;.ssh&lt;/code&gt; folder&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>htop/top is a useful command that helps users understand how much of there CPU (Different core)/RAM are being used. We would like to see the same for GPU there are tools that provide that, but sadly unlike cpu top/htop the ones for GPU are sadly fragmented. Based on your GPU vendor we have different tools to provide us this graphical info.
Note: I am talking about tools i tested in Ubuntu/Debian Linux</description>

      <title>How I Setup Dark Theme in My Blog</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/how-i-setup-dark-theme-in-my-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 10:49:39 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/how-i-setup-dark-theme-in-my-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dark mode or night mode is becoming more and more popular these days. As the amount of time we are spending in front of the computer increases, we started to look more into on how to improve our experience. Dark mode/Night mode is one such setting. What it does (mainly) is it makes all the white part of the application to black - major chunk of which would be the background. When the color of the background is made black, it emits less light. Now not all displays are the same, each display creates the dark color in different ways. Like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;LCD screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The liquid crystal elements block the white light from the backlight. And this results in a dark (almost black) pixel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;OLED screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The pixel is turned off, no light is emitted, this produces a deep black.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;CRT screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The electron beam is turned off as it passes the pixel. Producing no phosphorescent glow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;e-Ink screen&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Little spherical beads which are half black/half white, are rotated so their black side is facing outwards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless as you can see, darker colors results in less lights being emitted and leading to less strain to the eye. As a person who spend more time in front of a screen, I cannot fathom how useful this is. I have been a huge advocate of using night color/night mode in computer to improve developer health. Hence this article and why my blog has a dark mode now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using String in Active Record(Rails) Enum</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/using-string-as-active-record-enum/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 31 May 2022 20:10:36 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/using-string-as-active-record-enum/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rails model helps you define enum on a database integer field quite easily. The enum method which rails provide in its model is not an interface to the enum datatype available in some databases, but converting or using a integer field as an enum. Enum type or Enumerated type is user defined data type where you define the set of value the data type will have. If you consider regular or basic or primitive data types, they are pretty much like enum where the values it can hold is defined already by the language. Ruby dynamic type system does hide all this complexity for us while we develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enum is quite useful when you want to make sure that only a specified list of values are saved for a field.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I am currently a senior Ruby on Rails programmer. This article is my tribute to PHP the language that introduced me to the real world.
I have been programming or aspiring to program (former/recovering imposter syndrome addict) since I was a child. You can say I was programming as well if you consider lego programming and hello world in turbo c as programming. During upper primary and high school I spend my time learning Java, C and C++.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indexes are an integral part of any production database. It improves the speed of your query, and which in tern speeds up your application. The faster you get your data, faster you can provide the result to your user, faster you can move on to your next user. Knowing different type of indexes allows you to choose which is the best for your data. As there is no silver bullet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PostgreSQL is the DB refereed to in this article&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is my humble attempt to explain and simplify what is Gin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It start with one, then two and it keeps on growing. The number of routes in your ruby on rails project can be a reflection of how complex your project is becoming. And if you are curious like me to know how many routes your project has, just run the following command in your rails console.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a followup on my 2020 article on the list of books I have read in 2020. Here is 2021 version. I aimed to read at least one book a month in 2021. During some months I was able to achieve more than one book a month, but sadly I couldn&amp;rsquo;t keep it up for the whole year. 2022 is another year, hope to be able to do one book a month minimum this year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Consequences of saying NO</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/no/</link>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/no/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is not against saying No. One should exercise no to protect ones individual wishes, freedom and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is about consequence of saying no or frequent no to your colleague(s), child or partner for something they want to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you tell no, three things can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say No they don&amp;rsquo;t do it&lt;/strong&gt;, but it lingers in there mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say No, they do it. And the bad thing you why they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it happens&lt;/strong&gt;. Following this the person can learn to appreciate you, or just hate you still. (Well humans are like that)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the thing one should fear the most. &lt;strong&gt;You say No, they do it and everything went fine&lt;/strong&gt;. With that they stop asking you for permission and even loosing respect to your advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above situation can be a good example of game theory, where the result of your advice or decision of saying No. Depends on how the other person react to it and its result.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Right vs Wrong (Part 1)</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/right-vs-wrong-part-1/</link>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/right-vs-wrong-part-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no better examples of evolving definition (during the lifetime of person) than the definition of right or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are little the definition of Right and Wrong is absolute. The adults define them (especially our parents). What the show as Right is Right and what they treat as Wrong is Wrong. That is the time when everyone see right and wrong as binary, the simpler times which our mind will ache for in future. Telling lies are wrong, stealing is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we grow right around the time we start school, we learn that right and wrong are relative. There are little lies and big lies, little truths and honest truth. We learn to navigate this world with our friends and young foolish loves. This relative truths are based on the absolute truth from which we grew. Where in the absolute world a lie is wrong. In the relative world, simple and small lie here and there is fine. As long as it doesn’t hurt anyone, and it makes your life simpler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/books-i-read-2020/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have seen many people write about the favorite books that they read in (2020, 2019, etc). I have a friend who has been posting regularly for almost a decade. Feeling inspired from this, here is my list of books that I read in 2020. I do like reading books, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to keep up with as much as I would have loved to read. 2020 allowed me to catch up a bit, and hope to continue that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS: Unlike most others who write their favorites, mine is pretty much just a list of books I read.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What You Learn From Binge Watching</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/what-you-learn-from-binge-watching/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Binge Watching or Marathon watching is the practice of watching multiple episodes of a television program in rapid succession, typically by means of DVDs or digital streaming (Source: Oxford Dictionary). It has become a more common pass time or activity for the common people. It has become something that is planned and prepared to do alone or as a group. The availability of shows on demand through streaming service is the reason behinds huge growth of this activity, from a casual reference here and there to a more common social activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is the joy of waiting for each episode, per week. Discussing theories for the next episode and reviews of the previous one with friends or other fans. This is still there even when you binge watch. Just that instead of the next episode you are discussing about the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I wanted to write is not about what binge watching is or how it is (or it is not) good. What I wanted to talk about is, what I learned or noticed binge watching old TV shows or a long 10/11 season TV shows. The good points that I feel like is good to know or keep in mind in ones life. The one here is me of course 😁.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>[TIL] Starting Ruby Method With Capital Letter</title>

      <description>Last day while I was browsing through some Java code online, I noticed that some method has names starting with capital letters. I Method names are written in small letters in ruby. This Java code made me wonder if there was anything preventing us from using method names starting with capital letter, in ruby. So I started my irb and wrote the following code.
1 2 3  def Test puts &amp;#39;testing 123&amp;#39; end   And when I ran to call the method Test in the irb i got the following error.</description>

      <title>Review on Rail 4.3.0 Beta</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/review-on-rail-4.3.0-beta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Active Job, deliver later will give us a lot of abstraction. One will have to move the business logic present in workers to models or services, but that would make our system more maintainable. If the Active Job is a simple plug and play then in future projects one can use delayed_job when the load is light and when the load increases they can shift to redis based resque or sidekiq. Thinking of migrating from one system to another always give the developers a head ache. This can essentially solve it. Active Job was planned to be a feature in rails 4.0 but later they decided not. I am glad that they are releasing it in 4.2&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Convert Short Urls to Long Urls</title>
      <link>https://hsps.in/post/convert-short-urls-to-long-urls/</link>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/convert-short-urls-to-long-urls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to get a long/actual url from a short url?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when we try to fetch short urls, using curl, we get a blank page as reply or a 301 ERROR. The reason being that there is no html file stored at that location,only a header with details ,on where the person who has opened the url would be redirected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to get the actual url or long url from the short url, we just have to read the location stored in the html header.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to some unfortunate events&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loosing my phone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K-alarm crashing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I faced a common problem for many people &amp;ldquo;No alarm to wake me up in the morning&amp;rdquo;. Like every single man, I love sleeping. So unless an alarm or person wakes me up, I will continue to enjoy sleeping - until the urge from my second passion (hunger) wakes me up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I love sleeping, my team mates at Ruby Kitchen, won&amp;rsquo;t be happy with me coming late to work. Challenged with such a problem, I did what every computer hacker would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrote a program to wake me up, at 6:00 AM 😁&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lot of people might have a confusing between the functionality of update_attribute and update_attributes. The purpose of these functions can be understood from their name itself. the first one update_attribute would update a single attribute of the model&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To run a ruby program we use the command &lt;code&gt;ruby&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ruby program_name.rb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruby being an interpreter style language, each line is interpreted(read) one after the other and executable object code file is created for reuse like in case of compiler languages C, C++, etc.. To run a ruby code you need a ruby interpreter installed in your system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Setup Postgresql and Its Libraries to Work With Rails</title>

      <guid>https://hsps.in/post/setup-postgresql-and-its-libraries-to-work-with-rails/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently lot of people have been asking me why they are not able to install the pg (PostgreSQL) gem even after installing PostgreSQL server in their system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well the answer is simple, the pg gem, requires the PostgreSQL development libraries to build native extensions to communicate with the PostgreSQL server. Native extensions refer to building ruby extensions or wrappers for existing C or C++ library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can install the development libraries of PostgreSQL by installing the libpg-dev package.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time you download a RPM package for installation / updation via yum in Centos / Redhat system it gets deleted automatically after the procedure. Its a rather handy process by which your systems does not waste space storing the installation files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to keep those packages in your system, and maybe create a local repository?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well there are several ways. Simplest of them would be to edit the yum configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Many a times I wanted to create my own customized ubuntu, why???
Well 3 reasons
 I hate having to download the same set of softwares over and over gain, while I reinstall OS. Lot of my friends want the same set of softwares that I use, so making an ISO will help those out without a stable and unlimited net connection. I think its cool. So I have decided to make my own customized ubuntu with lot of programming tools, documentations and compilers added on to it by default.</description>
