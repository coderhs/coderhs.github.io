      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developing and deploying to the cloud has become a mandatory requirement than a nice to have skill. The promise of the cloud is that it abstracts all the complexity of managing a server and you only pay for what you use. If you accept that at face value, then the cloud is 100% legit. You only pay for what you use (just the cost is high), and they do abstract the regular complexity, and create some new complexity to worry about. There is a reason why AWS offers certificate programs. AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner/Architect/SysOps Admin/Developer/Solution Architect/Dev Ops Engineer all these shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be there if all the complexity were truly abstracted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now that I have finished writing my frustration about cloud, lets return to the main topic of this article.
