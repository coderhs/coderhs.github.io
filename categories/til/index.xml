      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I am using Aprtment gem to manage my multi schema database, and this article is written with expectation you know and use that gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple schema in your rails application, it is important for them to remain consistent. Rails migration is run by keeping track of the timestamp prefixed in front of its file name, it store&amp;rsquo;s the database. So when you restore a schema that hasn&amp;rsquo;t ran the migration, but rest of the schema&amp;rsquo;s has it rails thinks its already ran the migration. Rails look at the main / default schema to know if has ran the migrations then follow up on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It start with one, then two and it keeps on growing. The number of routes in your ruby on rails project can be a reflection of how complex your project is becoming. And if you are curious like me to know how many routes your project has, just run the following command in your rails console.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Last day while I was browsing through some Java code online, I noticed that some method has names starting with capital letters. I Method names are written in small letters in ruby. This Java code made me wonder if there was anything preventing us from using method names starting with capital letter, in ruby. So I started my irb and wrote the following code.
1 2 3  def Test puts &amp;#39;testing 123&amp;#39; end   And when I ran to call the method Test in the irb i got the following error.</description>
