      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: I am using Apartment gem to manage my multi schema database, and this article is written with expectation you know and use that gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have multiple schema in your rails application, it is important for them to remain consistent. Rails migration is run by keeping track of the timestamp prefixed in front of its file name. It stores the database. So when you restore a schema that hasn&amp;rsquo;t ran the migration, but rest of the schemas has it, rails thinks it has already ran the migration. Rails look at the main / default schema to know if it has ran the migrations  and then follow up on the rest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Running the following command in your console Readline::HISTORY.to_a returns the array of commands you have typed in console. After which you can treat it like any other array in ruby - search, sort, etc.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lot of people might have a confusing between the functionality of update_attribute and update_attributes. The purpose of these functions can be understood from their name itself. the first one update_attribute would update a single attribute of the model&lt;/p&gt;</description>
