      <p>I have seen many people write about the favorite books that they read in (2020, 2019, etc). I have a friend who has been posting regularly for almost a decade. Feeling inspired from this, here is my list of books that I read in 2020. I do like reading books, but I haven&rsquo;t been able to keep up with as much as I would have loved to read. 2020 allowed me to catch up a bit, and hope to continue that.</p>
<p>PS: Unlike most others who write their favorites, mine is pretty much just a list of books I read.</p>
<h2 id="courage-to-be-disliked">Courage to be Disliked</h2>
<p>by Ichiro Kishimi (Author), Fumitake Koga  (Author)</p>
<p>This is the only non fictional or slightly non fictional book I could finish in 2020. Its a conversation between two people, about (you guessed it) the courage to be disliked. I loved it personally as many thoughts reflected what I and several people, struggle in their regular life.</p>
<p>It took me quite a bit of time to finish the book, due to the tough subject. But I am glad that I finished it.</p>
<h2 id="if-it-bleeds---4-short-stories">If it Bleeds - 4 short stories</h2>
<p>by Stephen King (Author).</p>
<p>Now I must admit, the reason why I brought this book was because of the writers popularity. I really like the movies based on his book.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of 4 short stories. My favorite was the one wth the name &ldquo;If It Bleeds&rdquo;, because the character there is based of another book of stephen king called Mr. Mercedes. I haven&rsquo;t read that book, but I have seen its TV Series (all 3 seasons), so when I realized that the character here was from there it really peaked my interest. Its a good read, can&rsquo;t complain.</p>
<h1 id="anansi-boys">Anansi Boys</h1>
<p>by Neil Gaiman</p>
<p>This was recommended to me by my cousin. Out of all the books, I would say this was most humorous one, and a good fantasy. I loved the growth of the character and the brothers realizing what both wanted in life.</p>
<h1 id="blue-moon---lee-child">Blue Moon - Lee Child</h1>
<p>by Lee Child</p>
<p>I found this book lying in street, and glad that I did. Its the first novel of Lee Child that I have read. A book in the Jack Reacher Series. Its about an american military policeman who is navigating through life after service. I don&rsquo;t know much about the other books in the series, though I did watch the two movies based on the books.</p>
<p>Its a good action novel, the only action (hand to hand) novel I read in 2020 year as well.</p>
<h1 id="invisible-life-ivan-isaneko">Invisible Life Ivan Isaneko</h1>
<p>by Scott Stambach</p>
<p>Its a story about a 17 year old boy who is born with severe disabilities (and short life span), and have spend whole of his life at the hospital. (After being abandoned by his mother).</p>
<p>The way Ivan handles life, his love for books and his mental curiosity about the simplest things allowing him to have a wild imagination. Those are the things one would find thought provoking when they read this.</p>
<p>The evolution of the character is what I liked the most in this book.</p>
<h1 id="breaking-sky">Breaking Sky</h1>
<p>by Cori McCarthy (Author)</p>
<p>This is the first book I bought, in a really long time. Infact I bought it in 2019.</p>
<p>The story is set in the future with a military scenario, where a group of teenagers (young adults) is recruited to help pilot a futuristic fighter plane, that is super fast.</p>
<p>My motivation to buy this book was the storyline. Being set in the future, and about the military, I was hoping this book to be a fast read and allow me to get back into my old reading habits. The first half of the story progressed relatively slow, but it gave a good understanding of everything that&rsquo;s happening in that timeline. But the finish was too fast, but over all a good book.</p>
<h1 id="revival---stephen-king">Revival - Stephen king</h1>
<p>A nice horror by Stephen King, it talks about addiction and loss of loved ones - how it affects others. Stephen King novels doesn&rsquo;t need much description ðŸŽƒ</p>
<p>And I hope to read all of his works one day.</p>
<h1 id="false-impression---jeffery-archer">False Impression - Jeffery Archer</h1>
<p>Like Stephen King, Jeffery Archer is another favorite author of mine. I have read his books growing up and found it always interesting. His books are always a page turner.</p>
<p>This one is about art and its happening the same time as 9/11 (New York). In fact she (fiction) was in the building when the towers were hit. During all those a turmoil she is trying to do the right thing, save an old lady from being robbed of her family money. Finding way to travel during the 9/11, navigating through the Art world, assassination attempts, etc.</p>
<p>The author took great time and effort to detail everything. Even did justice to the description of what happened in New York during 9/11.</p>
<h2 id="2021">2021</h2>
<p>Keeping with the progress I made in 2020, I hope to read regularly and more in 2021. Reading, for me personally, activates my creativity more than just watching a movie, and that is my real aim with reading. I hope read at least 12 book this year, and already have a few titles in mind.</p>
